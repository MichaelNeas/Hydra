## Hydra
<h3>Senior Project - 3D Printed Elbow-Down Prosthetic</h3>

##We won 1st place at UCONN Senior Design!!!!!!!!!

  <li>Intelligent Ardunio Servo Control</li>
  <li>Dynamic Android Phone Application</li>
  <li>Moto 360 Wearable Technology</li>

## Motivation
The reason for Hydra's existence is purely based on our love for technology and desire to give back.  We are 4 Computer Science and Engineering students from The University of Connecticut and we wanted our Senior Design Project to be different.  A project that we could feel significant accomplishment from and learn as much as we possibly could in the process.
