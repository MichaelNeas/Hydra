## Hydra 
#### Senior Project - 3D Printed Elbow-Down Prosthetic

## We won 1st place at UCONN Senior Design!!!!!!!!!

## Features
- Customizable Solidworks files aimed for scalability and reprintability.
- Intelligent Ardunio Servo Control
- Dynamic Android Phone Application
- Moto 360 Wearable Technology

## Motivation
The reason for Hydra's existence is purely based on our love for technology and desire to give back.  We are 4 Computer Science and Engineering students from The University of Connecticut and we wanted our Senior Design Project to be different.  A project that we could feel significant accomplishment from and learn as much as we possibly could in the process.
